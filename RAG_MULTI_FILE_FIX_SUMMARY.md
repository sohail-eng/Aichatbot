# RAG Multi-File Search Fix Summary

## Issue Description

The RAG (Retrieval-Augmented Generation) system was not finding data from all attached files when processing user questions. Specifically, when users uploaded multiple files (like `BGPData.csv` and `InterfaceData.csv`) and asked questions, the system was only returning results from one file, typically the one with higher similarity scores.

### Problem Analysis

1. **Root Cause**: The RAG search was using a single search across all files and only returning the top N results by similarity score
2. **Impact**: Files with lower similarity scores (even if relevant) were being excluded from the final results
3. **Example**: When asking "which device status is down what is its neighboring ip", only BGPData.csv results were returned, even though InterfaceData.csv contained relevant DOWN status information

## Technical Details

### Original Search Flow
```python
# Original approach - single search across all files
search_results = self.search_relevant_chunks(session_id, question, file_names)
# Only top N results returned, potentially missing relevant data from other files
```

### Problem with Similarity Scores
- **BGPData.csv**: Similarity scores around -0.37 to -0.42
- **InterfaceData.csv**: Similarity scores around -0.46 to -0.53
- **Result**: Only BGPData.csv results appeared in top results

## Solution Implemented

### 1. Enhanced Search Terms Extraction (`ai_services/file_analyzer.py`)

**Improvement**: Added semantic variations for network/device terminology
```python
# Device status variations
if any(term in question_lower for term in ['status', 'down', 'up', 'offline', 'online']):
    semantic_variations.extend(['status', 'down', 'up', 'offline', 'online', 'adminstatus', 'intstatus'])

# Neighbor/connection variations  
if any(term in question_lower for term in ['neighbor', 'neighboring', 'ip', 'address', 'connection']):
    semantic_variations.extend(['neighbor', 'neighboring', 'ip', 'address', 'connection', 'neighboraddress', 'neighbor_system_name'])
```

### 2. Improved CSV Chunking (`ai_services/chroma_service.py`)

**Improvement**: Enhanced chunking to better capture data structure and create specialized chunks
```python
# Status-specific chunks
if status_columns:
    for status_col in status_columns:
        # Create chunks for each status value (UP/DOWN)
        for status_value in ['DOWN', 'down', 'UP', 'up']:
            status_data = df[df[status_col] == status_value]
            # Create specialized chunks for status data

# Neighbor-specific chunks
if neighbor_columns:
    for neighbor_col in neighbor_columns:
        # Create chunks for neighbor information
        neighbor_data = df[df[neighbor_col].notna() & (df[neighbor_col] != '')]
```

### 3. Multi-File Search Strategy (`ai_services/rag_service.py`)

**Improvement**: Implemented per-file search with guaranteed inclusion
```python
# Search each file separately
for file_name in file_names:
    file_results = self.search_relevant_chunks(session_id, question, [file_name], n_results=3)
    file_results_map[file_name] = file_results

# Ensure at least one result from each file
for file_name in file_names:
    if file_name in file_results_map and file_results_map[file_name]:
        best_result = max(file_results_map[file_name], key=lambda x: x.score)
        final_results.append(best_result)

# Add additional results from all files
remaining_results.sort(key=lambda x: x.score, reverse=True)
final_results.extend(remaining_results[:3])
```

## Results

### Before Fix
- Only BGPData.csv results returned
- InterfaceData.csv data completely excluded
- Users missed relevant information from multiple files

### After Fix
- Results from both files included
- Guaranteed representation from each file
- Better coverage of relevant data across all uploaded files

### Example Output
```
Sources:
  1. BGPData.csv (sample_data) - Score: -0.375
  2. InterfaceData.csv (status_info) - Score: -0.468  
  3. BGPData.csv (sample_data) - Score: -0.380
```

## Files Modified

1. **`ai_services/file_analyzer.py`**
   - Enhanced `_extract_search_terms()` method
   - Added semantic variations for network terminology

2. **`ai_services/chroma_service.py`**
   - Enhanced `_extract_csv_chunks()` method
   - Added status-specific and neighbor-specific chunks
   - Fixed metadata serialization issues

3. **`ai_services/rag_service.py`**
   - Modified `get_context_for_question()` method
   - Implemented per-file search strategy
   - Added guaranteed inclusion of results from each file

## Testing

The fix was validated using debug scripts that:
1. Processed both BGPData.csv and InterfaceData.csv files
2. Searched for relevant data using the original query
3. Verified that results from both files were included in the final context

## Benefits

1. **Comprehensive Coverage**: Users now get relevant information from all uploaded files
2. **Better Search Quality**: Enhanced search terms and chunking improve relevance
3. **Guaranteed Inclusion**: At least one result from each file ensures no data is missed
4. **Improved User Experience**: More complete and accurate responses to multi-file questions

## Future Improvements

1. **Dynamic Result Allocation**: Adjust number of results per file based on relevance
2. **Cross-File Correlation**: Identify relationships between data in different files
3. **Advanced Chunking**: Implement more sophisticated chunking strategies for different file types
4. **Query Optimization**: Further improve search term extraction for domain-specific queries
