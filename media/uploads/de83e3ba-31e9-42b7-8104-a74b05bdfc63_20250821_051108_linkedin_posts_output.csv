Software Engineer | AI & Machine Learning | Deep Learning Enthusiast | Web Scraping Expert | FastAPI Developer",4d,"🔥 Excited to share my new project – Calories Burnt Prediction using Machine Learning!
In this project, I worked on analyzing and predicting the number of calories burnt based on different biometric and activity parameters such as age, weight, height, duration, and heart rate.
💡 What I did in this project:
📊 Performed data cleaning and preprocessing to ensure quality inputs
🔍 Conducted Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA) to understand fitness trends
🤖 Built and trained machine learning models (Scikit-learn) to predict calorie burn
📈 Compared model performance and visualized results
📝 Documented insights and future improvements
🛠 Tech Stack & Tools Used:
Python 🐍
Pandas, NumPy (Data handling)
Matplotlib, Seaborn (Visualization)
Scikit-learn (Machine Learning)
Jupyter Notebook (Experimentation & analysis)
🚀 Key Outcomes:
Achieved accurate calorie predictions based on activity features
Discovered trends between heart rate, duration, and calories burnt
Built a foundation for real-world applications in fitness tracking and health monitoring
GitHub Link: (https://lnkd.in/eDAqYTJu)
🔮 Next Steps:
Deploy the model into a web/mobile app
Integrate with wearable devices for real-time predictions
Experiment with deep learning models for improved accuracy
💬 I’d love to hear your thoughts, feedback, and suggestions on how I can take this project to the next level!

Happy Independence Day. 

I know it’s very challenging to survive here, but there are many things we can be proud of—like our natural diversity (we have deserts and snow-covered valleys), great leaders such as Quaid-e-Azam, Imran Khan’s vision, Abdul Sattar Edhi’s humanitarian work, and Maryam’s contributions in Lahore and other parts of Punjab. Our army has performed exceptionally well in recent times. And we are blessed with so much more.

The first version uses memoization by caching previous results, making it drastically faster for large n.
 The second version recalculates the same values repeatedly, leading to exponential time complexity.
 With memoization, fabonacci(100) runs almost instantly — while the naive version may crash or hang.

From renewed geopolitical tensions and evolving trade policies to groundbreaking advancements in AI and digital transformation, today's current affairs underscore the critical need to stay informed and adaptable.
Key highlights include:
• Geopolitical Shifts: With significant policy changes in major economies and unpredictable leadership moves, from trade wars to the re-negotiation of key international agreements, global markets remain volatile.
 • Economic Dynamics: Rising inflation, higher energy costs, and fiscal adjustments are reshaping consumer behavior and investment strategies—reminding us that resilience and innovative thinking are essential for sustainable growth. • Technological Advancements: The digital transformation wave continues to accelerate. AI is not only driving productivity but also redefining business models across industries, urging us to rethink how we harness technology for competitive advantage. • Climate & Sustainability: Amid ongoing debates around climate policies and environmental protection, businesses and governments alike are reassessing their strategies to mitigate risks and embrace green initiatives.
In this era of rapid change, staying abreast of current affairs isn’t just about being informed—it’s about positioning ourselves and our organizations to thrive amid uncertainty. Let's use these insights to drive strategic decisions, foster innovation, and build a more resilient future.

Did you know some scrapers are designed to collect live market prices displayed on canvas elements? Extracting data from such sources can be quite challenging since it isn't embedded in traditional HTML elements.

A powerful solution to this is leveraging WebSockets! WebSockets facilitate real-time, two-way communication between the client and the server. Many modern websites use this technology to deliver dynamic content, making it ideal for real-time data scraping. By tapping into WebSockets, you can access live data streams efficiently.
